## Usage

```
yarn add history history-extra
```

`history` is a peer dependency, and must be installed along side `history-extra`.

## Versions

The major version of `history-extra` should be compatible with the upstream `history` module with the same major version.

So far, it's only been tested with `^4.7.0` and newer.

## Methods

### `createHashStateHistory`

```
import { createHashStateHistory } from 'history-extra';
```

Works the same way that [createHashHistory in history](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/blob/master/README.md#usage) works, except that it supports state.
